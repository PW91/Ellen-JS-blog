    <h6>My inspiration for this travel life</h6>

    <div class='flex-container--space-between'>
    <div class='text-wrap'>
    <p>I grew up in a tiny town called Spaubeek, in the Netherlands. From a young age I always saw my grandpa looking through his World Atlas, he knew every country and its details by heart, just from sitting hours and hours in his chair studying. </p>
<p>When I turned 18 I felt the need to go see all the places for him, the places that I am sure he wish he had seen before he passed.</p>
    </div>
  <div class='text-wrap'>
<p>So with my Backpack, and his ashes with me I went around the world, and left a little piece of him everywhere. But I knew I couldnâ€™t take him everywhere and I needed help. </p>
<p>That was the first moment of realisation where I thought.. what if I knew a lot of people that could help me on this journey.. what if I had influence in the world? </p>

                <h6>My story</h6>
            <div class='flex-container--space-between'>
        <div class='text-wrap'>

        <p>My goal was to make Mondays feel like Fridays, thatâ€™s what success meant to me. Living every day! Not just for the weekends.</p>
<p><strong>With zero experience I started looking for ways, ways to become successful. </strong></p>
<p>I started connecting with people that were living a different lifestyle, I started investing in myself, I started learning something new every single day. </p>
<p>While everyone thought I was just living on the beach, doing nothing with my life. </p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, I was building my empire.</strong> </p>
</div>


  <div class='text-wrap'>
  <p>The first 3 months after starting my business I didnt make a penny, but how am I happy I didnâ€™t give up on myself. Within One year after starting my business I had crossed 1 million dollars in sales.  </p>
  <p><strong>The girl that nobody thought was really going to get anywhere in lifeâ€¦ </strong></p>
  <p>Since then I have spoken for universities, held my own masterminds around the world, had people fly out to come live with me for in-person mentorships and even taught a group of 100 millionaires how to create the life of their dreams. </p>
